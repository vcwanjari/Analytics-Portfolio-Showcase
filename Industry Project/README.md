# Project Title: Reducing Bad Flute and Damage Rejection Values in Drill

## Project Background
Indian Tool Manufacturers (ITM), a division of Birla Precision Technologies Ltd in Aurangabad, faced a significant issue with the rejection of drill bits due to bad flute and damage. In the previous year, the total value of drills produced was 3526 lakhs, out of which the rejection value due to bad flute and damage was 15.58 lakhs, accounting for 0.44% of the packing value. This defect was identified as one of the top issues affecting the production throughput of jobber drills.

## Problem Statement
The rejection of drills due to bad flute and damage is a major concern, impacting the overall productivity and efficiency of ITM. To address this problem, the project aims to:

1. Analyze the causes related to bad flute and damage rejection of drills.
2. Implement countermeasure plans to address the priority causes.
3. Reduce the rejection value attributed to bad flute and damage in drills.

## Objectives
The project objectives are as follows:

1. Conduct a comprehensive inspection of the problem related to bad flute and damage rejection of drills and study the causes associated with them.
2. Prioritize and implement countermeasure plans to address the identified causes.
3. Reduce the rejection value of drills due to bad flute and damage.

## Pareto Analysis
### What is a 'Pareto Analysis'?
Pareto Analysis is a decision-making technique based on the Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule. It involves statistically identifying a limited number of input factors that have the greatest impact on the desired or undesired outcome. In this analysis, it is observed that 80% of a project's benefit can be achieved by addressing only 20% of the causes or factors. Similarly, 80% of problems can be traced back to 20% of the causes.

### Understanding and Using Pareto's 80-20 Rule
The Pareto 80/20 Rule is widely used in various aspects of organizational and business management, including quality management, planning, decision-making, and performance management. By ranking and focusing on the causes or solutions with the largest impact, a disproportionate improvement can be achieved.

## Cause and Effect Analysis (Fishbone Diagram)
Cause and Effect Analysis, also known as a fishbone diagram, is a visual tool used to identify potential causes for a specific problem or effect. It helps capture different ideas and stimulate brainstorming within a team. The fishbone diagram consists of a line drawn across the page representing the problem statement, with several lines (branches) coming out vertically from the main line. Each branch is labeled with different categories to identify potential causes.

## Control Chart
Control charts, also known as Shewhart charts, are statistical process control tools used to determine if a manufacturing or business process is in a state of control. By plotting data in time order, control charts provide insights into the consistency and predictability of process variation. A control chart typically includes a central line for the average, an upper line for the upper control limit, and a lower line for the lower control limit. These lines are determined from historical data. Comparing current data to these lines helps identify whether the process is in control or affected by special causes of variation.
