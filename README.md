# Projects

### Power BI
**Project: Adventure Works Sales Report**

Description: In this project, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze the sales data of Adventure Works, a fictional company. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales performance, allowing users to explore key metrics, such as revenue, units sold, and profit, across different product categories, regions, and customer segments. Utilizing a variety of visualizations, including charts, maps, and slicers, the dashboard enables stakeholders to gain valuable insights into sales trends, identify top-performing products and regions, and make data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies.

### Python
**Project: Predicting Employee Churn at Salifort Motors**

Description: In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict employee churn at Salifort Motors, an automobile manufacturing company. By utilizing historical employee data, including factors such as job satisfaction, years of experience, and performance metrics, I employed data preprocessing techniques and feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling. Using classification algorithms, I built a predictive model that can identify employees at risk of leaving the organization. This enables proactive intervention and the implementation of retention strategies to mitigate churn and maintain a stable workforce.

**Project: TikTok Project - Data Exploration and Hypothesis Testing**

Description: This project involved an in-depth exploration of a dataset from the popular social media platform TikTok. Leveraging Python's data manipulation and visualization libraries, I analyzed various aspects of the data, including user engagement metrics, content characteristics, and audience demographics. By performing hypothesis testing, I validated assumptions and gained insights into factors influencing user behavior and engagement on the platform. This project aimed to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data to inform content creators and marketers on strategies to enhance user engagement and maximize reach.

**Project: Waze Project - Exploratory Data Analysis of Waze**

Description: In this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis on real-world traffic data sourced from the Waze navigation app. Leveraging Python's data analysis and visualization libraries, I delved into the dataset to uncover insights about traffic patterns, congestion hotspots, and factors affecting commute times. By visualizing the data through maps, charts, and statistical summaries, I identified recurring traffic bottlenecks, peak congestion hours, and potential areas for infrastructure improvements. The findings from this project can help transportation authorities and urban planners make informed decisions to optimize traffic flow and enhance the overall commuting experience.

### Excel
**Project: Renewable Energy Dashboard**

Description: The Renewable Energy Dashboard is an Excel-based tool designed to monitor and analyze renewable energy generation. By consolidating data from various sources, including solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric plants, the dashboard provides real-time visualizations and performance metrics. Leveraging Excel's features, such as formulas, conditional formatting, and pivot tables, I created dynamic charts and tables that enable users to track energy production, identify trends, and assess the efficiency of different energy sources. This project aims to support decision-making processes in promoting sustainable energy utilization and optimizing renewable energy infrastructure.

**Project: Video Games Sales Dashboard**

Description: The Video Games Sales Dashboard is an Excel-based project focused on analyzing sales data from the video game industry. By utilizing Excel's data manipulation and visualization capabilities, I created an interactive dashboard that presents key insights into video game sales trends, top-selling games, and gaming platforms. The dashboard features dynamic charts, slicers, and pivot tables to enable users to explore sales metrics by genre, region, and time period. This project serves as a valuable tool for game developers, marketers, and industry analysts to understand market dynamics, identify emerging trends, and make data-driven decisions to maximize sales and profitability.
